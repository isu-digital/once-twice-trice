Dr. Lendt “Jack’s[”] passing was a great shock to me! He was my First Love and I have many
Beautiful memories of him and our short Life together.
The night that he was Leaving for Minnesota with his Coach, He came to tell me good bye, we
kissed and hugged and he told me that he would come back to me as soon as he could."

I stood and bowed my head and then I heard that he walked from the field. I felt some what
relieved. Monday noon I was in the cafeteria. His Fraternity Bro “Mr Harold Tutt[”] came to get
me and said that I was to go to the Campus Hospital, I did. When I saw him I said [“]Hello
Darling” He looked at me, but never spoke.
I remember hearing the Campanile chime 3 o’clock. That was Oct 8th, 1923, and he was gone.
Sincerely Yours,
Cora Mae Trice Greene"
