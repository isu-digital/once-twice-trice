THE CURTIS HOTEL  
MINNEAPOLIS  

<div class="text-end">Oct 5, 1923</div>

To whom it may concern:-

My thoughts just before the first real college game of my life. The honor of my race, family, and self are at stake[.] Everyone is expecting me to do big things. I <u>will</u>! My whole body and soul are to be thrown recklessly about on the field tomorrow. Every time the ball is snapped I <u>will</u> be trying to do more than my part[.]
