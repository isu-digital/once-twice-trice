## Jack Trice Story

John “Jack” G. Trice was born on May 12, 1902, to Green and Anna Trice in Hiram, Ohio. He attended East Tech High School while living with his uncle in Cleveland. By his senior year, Trice had become a star athlete, playing on back-to-back undefeated teams.  

After the season’s end, Trice’s high school coach Sam Willaman was hired by Iowa State to coach football. He recruited six East Tech players to Ames, including Trice. That summer, Trice married Cora Mae Starlard. Trice entered Iowa State College in the fall of 1922 as a non-collegiate two-year agriculture student and, by the winter semester, had transitioned to a full-time student studying animal husbandry while participating in football, track, and the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. 

On October 5, 1923, the Cyclone football team traveled to Minneapolis to play the University of Minnesota. That night, in the Curtis Hotel, Trice penned his now famous “last letter.” The next day, during the first half of the game, Jack was injured—later to be reported as a broken collarbone—but returned to the game. As he was working to disrupt a play in the third quarter, he was trampled and severely injured. Trice was helped off the field, taken to a hospital to be examined, and cleared to return to Ames with his team. Shortly after arriving, he was admitted to the college hospital but passed away on October 8, 1923, from complications caused by the injury to his abdomen.

## Once


In 1971, the idea for a new football stadium was proposed to replace Clyde Williams Field. The ISU Foundation funded the project, and the University immediately began raising funds to purchase the stadium. During this time, a strong possibility for the stadium’s name was that of a generous donor. However, in 1973, the student body was introduced to the idea of Jack Trice Stadium.  

Throughout the 1970s, most of the student body supported naming the stadium after Trice, as evidenced by survey results, passed student legislation, votes during student elections, thousands of signatures on petitions, and countless articles in the Iowa State Daily and other media. Even so, in 1975, the stadium opened with no name. Less than a year later, the recommendation to name the stadium Cyclone Stadium—with a separate area to honor athletes, named for Trice—was made to the Board of Regents. The Board 
ultimately voted to postpone the decision to name the stadium until the university owned it.

## Twice

The early 1980s saw great demonstrations of support by the student body for Jack Trice Stadium through radio spots, an airplane banner, newspaper advertisements, a billboard, and armbands like those worn by Trice’s teammates in 1923. After the university took possession of the new stadium from the ISU Foundation, President W. Robert Parks’ recommendation of the name Cyclone Stadium at Jack Trice Field was unanimously approved by the Board of Regents. By the start of the 1984 season, the stadium was no longer unnamed.  

Following this partial win, the students still sought a tangible object to memorialize Trice. The Government of the Student Body (GSB) allocated $22,000 and commissioned Fairfield, Iowa, artist Christopher Bennett to craft a bronze statue of Trice dedicated during VEISHEA in 1988.

After ten seasons as Cyclone Stadium/Jack Trice Field, the torch for Jack Trice Stadium was relit by a GSB resolution to rename the stadium. After two years, in February 1997, President Martin Jischke proposed the recommendation presented to him by the Advisory Committee to the Board of Regents, who voted to change Cyclone Stadium/Jack Trice Field to Jack Trice Stadium. With this vote, the decadeslong skirmish ended, and Jack Trice Stadium was dedicated on August 30, 1997.
