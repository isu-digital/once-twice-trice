In February of 1995, Dustin Shaver revived the cause to name the stadium Jack Trice Stadium and proposed a new resolution to the GSB to rename Cyclone Stadium. Unlike many others, this resolution included a section that required it be raised to the attention of many powerful parties, including the President, Board of Regents, Athletic Director, Head Football Coach, ISU Foundation, and various media outlets.

## Advisory Committee (holding text)

In 1971, the idea for a new football stadium was proposed to replace Clyde Williams Field. The ISU Foundation funded the project, and the University immediately began raising funds to purchase the stadium. During this time, a strong possibility for the stadium’s name was that of a generous donor. However, in 1973, the student body was introduced to the idea of Jack Trice Stadium.  

Throughout the 1970s, most of the student body supported naming the stadium after Trice, as evidenced by survey results, passed student legislation, votes during student elections, thousands of signatures on petitions, and countless articles in the Iowa State Daily and other media. Even so, in 1975, the stadium opened with no name. Less than a year later, the recommendation to name the stadium Cyclone Stadium—with a separate area to honor athletes, named for Trice—was made to the Board of Regents. The Board 
ultimately voted to postpone the decision to name the stadium until the university owned it.

The early 1980s saw great demonstrations of support by the student body for Jack Trice Stadium through radio spots, an airplane banner, newspaper advertisements, a billboard, and armbands like those worn by Trice’s teammates in 1923. After the university took possession of the new stadium from the ISU Foundation, President W. Robert Parks’ recommendation of the name Cyclone Stadium at Jack Trice Field was unanimously approved by the Board of Regents. By the start of the 1984 season, the stadium was no longer unnamed.  

Following this partial win, the students still sought a tangible object to memorialize Trice. The Government of the Student Body (GSB) allocated $22,000 and commissioned Fairfield, Iowa, artist Christopher Bennett to craft a bronze statue of Trice dedicated during VEISHEA in 1988.

After ten seasons as Cyclone Stadium/Jack Trice Field, the torch for Jack Trice Stadium was relit by a GSB resolution to rename the stadium. After two years, in February 1997, President Martin Jischke proposed the recommendation presented to him by the Advisory Committee to the Board of Regents, who voted to change Cyclone Stadium/Jack Trice Field to Jack Trice Stadium. With this vote, the decadeslong skirmish ended, and Jack Trice Stadium was dedicated on August 30, 1997.
