The 1980s saw the second major push to name the stadium after Trice. Despite the Board of Regents' vote to delay naming the football stadium in 1976, students continued to show their support for Jack Trice Stadium through passing resolutions and bills in the Government of the Student Body and by demonstrating their support in highly visible ways. It was assumed that the University would own the stadium by the Spring of 1984, giving the students a new deadline.

During the VEISHEA 1980 celebration, the Jack Trice Memorial Foundation had a booth as part of the open house displays. They shared displays and distributed information at the booth, including a ticket to obtain this poster and mailer about Trice and his ideals.

In the fall of 1980, students started a marketing push to expand their efforts to gain support for naming the stadium in Trice's honor. During the October 25, 1980, game against Oklahoma, an airplane circled over the stadium for 40 minutes, trailed by a banner that read "Welcome to Jack Trice Stadium." The banner was the idea of Greg Douglas, GSB President, and Tom Jackson, GSB Vice President, who independently funded the plane.

Over the summer of 1981, ISU students Steve deProsse and Rick Yoder developed a plan for a billboard to keep alive the idea of naming the stadium in honor of Trice. The billboard idea was inspired by the airplane from the previous fall with the hope that it would have a larger impact since it would be up for a month. The billboard was installed in late August near the corner of Lincoln Way and Sherman Avenue at the cost of $240, which had been provided by the Iowa Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). Private donations were solicited to repay PIRG.

Following a debate by GSB Senators, a vote was held to allocate funds to promote the stadium's naming in honor of Trice during the game against Nebraska on November 15, 1980. Money was set aside for flyers, radio spots, an airplane, a banner, and a newspaper ad. During the game, radio spots ran on three radio stations in Ames and one in Shenandoah. A station in Des Moines refused to run the ad based on the Fairness Doctrine.  

Support for naming the football stadium in honor of Jack Trice was consistently strong among the student body, as evidenced by student-signed petitions, GSB legislation, and resolutions by student organizations. The Jack Trice Memorial Foundation worked to garner support from the ISU Faculty as well by polling faculty on their stance and by soliciting their support by inviting them to join the Foundation and to send postcards supporting the naming of the stadium after Trice to the Board of Regents.

The Government of the Student Body continued their support of naming the football stadium in honor of Jack Trice into the 1983 school year. The GSB Senate passed Resolution #83-001R supporting the naming of the stadium for Trice and designated the October 8 game versus Kansas, the 60th anniversary of Trice's death, to be dedicated in his honor. Days before the game, Athletic Department officials decided not to support the idea but later agreed to have a moment of silence during the 3rd quarter.

At a tailgate party before the game, signatures were gathered to support naming the stadium for Trice, and black armbands were passed out to those in attendance. An estimated 300-400 fans wore the armbands along with members of the band and Cy. The armbands harkened back to 1923 when Trice's teammates wore black armbands for the rest of the season after his death. 

Another tailgate was organized for the last game of the season, as it was anticipated that the University would take ownership of the stadium sometime in the spring, and the Regents would finally move to name it. At the game against Oklahoma State on November 19, fans again sported black armbands, while members of the band wore either black or white armbands to show their support in honor of Trice.

After the University took possession of the new stadium, President Parks moved to have the stadium named during the December 15, 1983, Board of Regents meeting. Parks recommended the stadium be named "Cyclone Stadium" and the playing surface "Jack Trice Field." Student, faculty, and staff representatives at the meeting asked that a vote be delayed until the spring Board meeting in Ames. After a failed motion to name the stadium "Jack Trice-Cyclone Stadium," a motion was made for a vote on President Parks' recommendation. This vote passed unanimously.

It was announced in September 1984 that the game on November 4 against Nebraska would see a ceremony to dedicate the naming of the new stadium and field. During the game's halftime, a ceremony was held to formally dedicate the naming of the stadium and field.    

<div class="clearfix"></div>

In October 1984, the Government of the Student Body allocated $1,732 and formed a committee to organize a dedication ceremony for naming the field in honor of Jack Trice. On November 4, 1984, a dedication ceremony was held in the Great Hall of the Memorial Union to commemorate the naming of Jack Trice Field. The event started with a luncheon and was followed by comments from Donald Kaul, a journalist with the Cedar Rapids Gazette and longtime Trice Stadium supporter, and Chester Trice, Jr., Jack's second cousin.

Despite the University's recognition of Trice by naming the football field in his honor in 1984, the student body still sought a "tangible object" to memorialize him, among other scholarships and awards. In 1985, GSB unanimously passed a resolution to allocate $22,000 toward erecting a Jack Trice statue. Artist Christopher Bennett of Fairfield, Iowa, was commissioned to craft this bronze piece, dedicated during the 1988 VEISHEA celebrations.

The statue was originally located on central campus outside of Beardshear Hall, moved in 1997 when the stadium was renamed, and ultimately replaced in central campus in 2019 to increase the presence of Trice's legacy on campus. It has been said that the piece is larger than life to embody Trice's extraordinary spirit. 

The Trice family has remained a part of his story at Iowa State throughout the last century. In 1988, Herbert and Betty Armstrong, the daughter of Cora Mae Trice Greene (Trice's widow) and her husband Homer Lee Greene, wrote to ISU President Gordon P. Eaton about their plans to visit Ames and see the newly erected statue of Jack Trice. They were shown around campus and took photos and videos to share with Cora Mae, who lived in California. In response, Cora Mae shared her gratitude for the students and other contributors who raised the money for the statue and her poignant recollections from the fateful events in early October of 1923.
